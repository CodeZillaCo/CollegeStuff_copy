The curse of dimensionality refers to the various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dmension spaces that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space if everday expience.
The curese generally refers to the issues that arise when the number of datapoints in small (in a suitable defined sense) relatice to the intrinsic dimension of data.
When the dimensionalityincreases, the volume of the space increases so dast that the available data become sparse. In order to obrain a reliable result, the amount of data needed often grows exponentially with the dimensionality. As the number of features or dimension grows.....


PCA Principal component Analysis (PCA)
is a technique for dimensionality reduction that identifies a set of orthogonal axes (Perpendicular Axes), called Principal components, that capture the maximum variance in the data.


DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION : 
High DImensional spcace to low dimensional space so that it would retain some meaningful properties of the original data, ideally close to its intrinsic dimension.



36 Col and 2,3 cols ( PCA )



THe first component captures the most variation of the data, the second component captures the maximum variance from the First component.

PCA employs a linear transformation that is based on preserving the most variance in the data using the leas number of dimensions.
