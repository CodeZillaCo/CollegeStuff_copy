Two processes P1 and P2 are following a shared memory concept. Create a common memory pool where the P1 writes data, P2 reads from it 

Key_t key is a unique identifier for the pool

shmget(Key_t key,size_t size,int shmflg);
To create a common memory pool.

int shmid = shmget((key_t) 1234, 2048, 0666|IPC_CREAT);
[ This will return a unique id which is the shmid that is used in shmat !!]
[On failure it will return -1]
[On success returns a valid identifier]

shmat(int shmid,const void* shmaddr, int shmflg);
{shmaddr is the address space of the process to which the }
shmat(shmid, NULL ,0);
