I - unit

1 - Types of data , struc,semi,  | examples cases of use
2 - Big data ecosystem , haddom, spark,
3 - 7 steps



II - unit

1 - SciPy - Skeqness, Sklearn




5x5 data importing > data cleanign > Mean, mode median > matplotlib

string operations (RegEx)


III unit

1. Data prograession
2. where is data taken from
3 . Structured > Semi-structured ( JSON )




Fill with median or mode..
With eratic data scaling using minMaxScaler and z-score.





categorical column > string type | 
	1. One hot encoding
	2. Label encoding

Nominal data vs ordinal data

Nominal : State,Name,Gender
Ordinal : Grades.

1 hot encoding is when unique values in a nominal column is taken as seperate columns and is entered with 0 and 1 to show that the row has that column






uni veri analysis
multi veri analysis

co-relation
multi-co-linearity




Sort in ascending order
find median
cut the values in to hapf again at the median and find the median for those again.s
spliting at the medians again willresult in 4 segments..
the two quadrants at each end will contain the outliers..

i = IQR = Q3 - Q1
Lower fence = Q1 - 1.5 IQR
Upper fence = Q3 + 1.5 IQR


defentions for mean mode covariance
variance



simple random sampeling
systematic sampleing ( some rule )
Statified sampeling ( overalping sample)
Cluster sampleing ( non - sampeling )


SNOWBALL sampoleimng ( 5 sample calls 5 other sample each and creates a larger sample space )
