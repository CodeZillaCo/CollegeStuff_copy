Regressions
    - Linear Regression (simple)
        Output is ready
    - Logistic Regression   
        Output is a probability


Machine Learning ->  sklearn


Get DF ready and cleaned
split the Dependent columns form the independet ones
Split Df datas into Train and Test. (70-30 || 80-20)

Split parameters - statified,shuffle

-> The output is different on every run due to shuffled splitting
-> To prevent this the random state is stored with a reference so that he output is similar   | (Seperate Concept)

SKLEARN SPLIT >>> https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html

accuracies - Teting, training

X(train) -> Y(train) -> Y(predicit)        |    Training Accuracy
With the trained model :
    X(test) - Y(test) -> Y(predicit)       |    Model Accuracy
