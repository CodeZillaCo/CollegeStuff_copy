What are Data?
    - Raw Facts
What are data structures?
    - Logical + Efficient Data Storage + Organization + Retrieval
    - Program : Data Structures + Algorithms
    - Types :
        ~ Liner Data Structures (Arrays,Stack..)
        ~ Non-Linear Data Structures (Linked Lists, Tree,..)


Abstract Data Types (Mathematical Models => Set of operations + Set of lists) [ examples : classes | like : list,dict,set] { A mathematical model in which you have a set of values over which you can peform a set of operations}
    - List ADT (Array implementation)
        ~ Inertions
        ~ Search
        ~ Remove
        ~ Traversal
